In this pipeline data from major biological databases, for instance sequences from
GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), species distribution data from GBIF (www.gbif.org),
climatic data from BioClim (www.worldclim.org), and fossil records from Paleobiology
(http://paleodb.org), are merged and used to perform phylogenetic analyses resulting
in big trees of metazoa, plants and funghi, which can be used for meta-analyses.

The overall purpose of the phylota pipeline is to infer large-scale evolutionary
patterns, which in turn can help improve our understanding of the historical assembly
of biomes, and the response of biodiversity to past episodes of climate change.
